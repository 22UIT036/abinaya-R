<h3><ul>
<li>Knead the dough for the Kulcha
To prepare the dough, take a large bowl and sieve the flour in it. Add baking powder, baking
soda, curd and refined oil in it. Add sugar and salt in the flour and mix it well with your fingers.
Add warm milk in flour and knead the mixture to prepare a firm dough. Cover it with a damp
cloth and keep it aside.</li>
<li>Step 2 Prepare the potato filling
To make the stuffing for the kulcha, take the boiled potato and mash it in a bowl. Combine
finely chopped onions and green chillies with mashed potato. Add chat masala, coriander
leaves, red chilli powder and cumin powder in the mixture. Sprinkle salt and mix the ingredients
with a spoon.</li>
<li>Step 3 Roll the Kulchas
Now take the dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball and then
flatten the ball using a rolling pin. Place a spoonful of aloo filling in the centre of the flatten
dough and close the kulcha well. Sprinkle some flour over it and roll it again into a paratha.</li>
<li> Step 4 Toast the Kulchas on both side
Take a non-stick pan, add olive oil and heat it over medium flame. When oil bubbles start to
rise, gently place the kulcha in the pan and cook for a minute. Flip the kulcha and cook the
other side till both sides turn crispy and golden brown in colour. Once done, serve hot with
Amritsari Chole.</li>
<li>Tips
You can also stuff crushed paneer along with aloo in the kulchas.
You can also spread some ghee or butter on your kulchas before serving.
Garnish your buttered kulchas with chopped coriander leaves and black sesame seeds.</li><li>Coming from the North Indian city of Amritsari, Amritsari kulcha is a flatbread stuffed with
potatoes, onions, cottage cheese, and spices. The flatbread is commonly garnished with
coriander seeds, cilantro, and red chili powder. Thin, crispy, and smeared with ghee butter, it is
a staple food in Amritsar, with almost every shop in the city sizzling with the sound of kulchas
baked in large tandoor ovens.
Not much is known about the history of this flavorful dish, and even the locals say that kulcha is
just something they have always eaten, a variation on numerous flatbreads that the country is
known for.</li>

<h3><ul>
<li>Indian tikka is a dish consisting of boneless meat, usually chicken, that is cut into smaller
pieces and marinated in yogurt and traditional Indian spices such as turmeric, cumin,
coriander, cayenne pepper, chili, garlic, and ginger. The meat is roasted over charcoal in a
tandoor, the traditional cylindrical clay oven.</li>
<li>Mix all the ingredients of the first marinade in a big bowl, add the cubed chicken and mix
well. Keep it aside for about half an hour.</li>
<li>In the meantime, start preparing the second marinade.</li>
<li>Heat 1 tablespoon of milk and add the saffron to it. Stir and keep it aside.</li>
<li>Heat the half tablespoon of vegetable oil in a pan. Add the 1 teaspoon of ajwain/carom
seeds and the chickpea flour and mix constantly with a wooden spoon at low heat, until it turns
a shade darker. It should smell nutty. Do not worry if it looks like the flour is lumping up, it is
okay. Keep it aside.</li>
<li>In a big mixing bowl, whisk together the yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, garam masala, 1
teaspoon of crushed ajwain/carom seeds, kasuri methi, turmeric, black pepper, red chili
powder, salt and the food color (if you are using it). Put the chicken pieces into this marinade,
add the saffron milk and the toasted chickpea flour and mix well. Add the mustard oil and mix
well. Keep it aside for at least 4 hours to overnight</li>
<li>When you are ready to cook the chicken, thread the cubes in the skewers. You can also
skip this part, if you are making the tikka to use in other dishes.</li>
<li>Put the skewered chicken on a tray covered with baking paper (or greased) and bake the
chicken in a pre-heated oven at 205°C – 215°C (400°F – 420°F) for about 15 minutes or until
cooked through.</li>
<li>Make sure to generously baste the chicken skewers with some ghee/oil on both sides and
turn them over a couple of times. To get the charred look and taste, broil the chicken for
another 3 to 5 minutes.
NOTE: Do not over cook the chicken or it will become tough and dry.</li>
<li>Serve the chicken tikka hot with sliced red onions, lemon wedges, Hari Chutney and some
freshly made Naan or Garlic Naan. You can sprinkle some Chaat Masala on it too if you
like. Enjoy!</li>

<center><h1><br>INGRIDIENTS AND RECIPIES<br></h1>
<li>This North Indian tikka variety consists of a combination of marinated paneer cheese and
vegetables that are cooked in a tandoor - a traditional Indian oven. This vegetarian version of
tikka is based on paneer, a crumbly cheese with a soft texture.
Pieces of paneer, tomatoes, onions, and peppers are skewered, grilled, and then seasoned
with lemon juice and chaat masala - a spicy powder. Sometimes the dish is served with various
salads or mint chutney on the side. Variations on the dish include paneer tikka masala, which is
served with spicy gravy, and paneer tikka rolls, which are wrapped in Indian bread.</li>
<li>Prep WorkPeel, rinse and dice 1 medium-sized onion in square shaped 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. Rinse and
slice 1 small to medium sized capsicum (green bell pepper) in 1 to 1.5 inches pieces.
You will need 1⁄2 cup each of onions and capsicum. Set these aside. You can also use tomatoes
if you want.</li>
<li>Crush 1.5 inches ginger and 6 to 7 small to medium sized garlic to a fine paste in a mortar-
pestle.
You will need 1 tablespoon of crushed ginger-garlic or 1 tablespoon of ready ginger-garlic
paste.</li>
<li>Slice 200 to 250 grams block or paneer into cubes or squares and keep aside. Best is to use
homemade paneer.</li>
<li>Make Tikka Marinade
Put 200 grams hung curd (greek yogurt) in a bowl. With a whisk beat the curd lightly till
smooth.</li>
<li>Now add 1 tablespoons ginger garlic paste or 1 tablespoon crushed ginger garlic to the
curd. Also add all the dry spice powders. Below you see the following Indian spice powders in
clockwise order:
2 teaspoons kashmiri red chili powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1⁄2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1⁄2 teaspoon garam masala powder
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur)
1 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds)
1 teaspoon chaat masala
1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper powder (optional)
Kashmiri red chili powder gives a nice red color to the food but is not spicy and hot.
Instead of kashmiri red chilli powder, you can add 2 teaspoons of sweet paprika or 1⁄2 to 1
teaspoon of cayenne pepper</li>
<li>Add 1⁄2 teaspoon black salt and regular salt as per taste. If you do not have black salt, then
skip it.</li>
<li>Add 1⁄2 tablespoon (1.5 teaspoons) lemon juice.</li>
<li>Next add 1 tablespoon mustard oil. If you do not have mustard oil, then use a neutral
tasting oil.</li>
<li>Mix very well. Check the taste and add more seasonings if required.</li>
<li>Add the onions, capsicum and paneer to the marinade.</li>
<li>Slowly and gently mix them with the marinade. Cover and keep the marinated paneer and
veggies in the refrigerator for 2 hours or more.</li>
<li>This is how they look after 2 hours.</li>
<li>Assemble and Grill Paneer Tikka
Begin to thread the veggies and paneer alternately on bamboo skewers. Before you begin to
thread preheat oven at 230 or 240 degrees Celsius or 464 degree Fahrenheit for 15 to 20
minutes.Use only the top heating element while preheating as well as grilling. Soak or rinse the bamboo
skewers before threading.</li>
<li> Place them on a tray lined with aluminium foil or parchment paper.</li>
<li>Brush with some oil all over.</li>
<li>Place the tray on the top rack and grill in the preheated oven for 7 to 10 minutes first at 230
to 240 degrees Celsius or 464 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>Then remove the tray from the oven and turn the paneer tikka skewers.</li>
<li>Again keep back on the top rack in the oven and continue to grill till the edges of paneer and
veggies are golden or slightly charred for about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Do not grill for a long time as then paneer becomes hard. Since temperatures vary from
oven to oven do keep a check.
You can reduce or increase the time as required. Total grilling time will be 15 to 20
minutes.</li>
<li> Remove once done. Serve the paneer tikka sprinkled with some chaat masala and lemon
juice. Also serve mint chutney, onion slices and lemon wedges as sides.</li>
